        I'll never feed off the evergreen luster of your heart All because we
        all live in the valley of the walls When they speak, we can peek from
        the windows of their mouths To see the land, the women chant as they fly
        up to the Sun
      </p>
      <p>
        You never think you know why, know You never think you know why, know
        Ever think you know why, know
      </p>
      <p>
        Books all say different things, while people flap their yellow wings
        Trying to soar by being a whore of life and almost everything The sheep
        that ran off from the herd may be dead But now's a bird able to fly,
        able to die, able to fuck your brother's earth
      </p>
